# Long Running Actions for MicroProfile

## Status

MicroProfile LRA proposal in progress

== Introduction

The specification introduces APIs for services to coordinate activities.

The main thrust of the proposal introduces an API for loosely coupled
services to coordinate long running activities in such a way as to
guarantee a globally consistent outcome without the need to take locks
on data.

== Motivation

In a loosely coupled service based environment there is sometimes a need
for different services to provide consistency guarantees. Typical
examples include:

* order processing involving three services (take order, bill customer,
ship product). If the shipping service finds that it is out of stock
then the customer will have been billed with no prospect of receiving
his item;
* an airline overbooks a flight which means that the booking count and
the flight capacity are inconsistent.

There are various ways that systems overcome such inconsistency but it
would be advantageous to provide a generic solution which handles
failure conditions, maintains state for those flows that span long
periods of time and ensures that remedial activities are called
correctly.

Traditional techniques for guaranteeing consistency in distributed
environments has focused on XA transactions where locks may be held for
long periods thereby introducing strong coupling between services and
decreasing concurrency to unacceptable levels. Additionally, if such a
transaction aborts then valuable work which may be valid will be rolled
back. In view of these issues an alternative approach is desirable.

Goals

* support long running actions
* no strong coupling between services
* allow actions to finish early
* allow compensating actions if a business activity is cancelled
