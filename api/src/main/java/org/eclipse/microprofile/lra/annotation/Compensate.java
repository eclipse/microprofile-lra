/**
 * When a resource method executes in the context of an LRA and if the containing
 * class contains a method annotated with `@Compensate` then the resource will
 * be used as a participant for the LRA. If this associated LRA is subsequently
 * cancelled then the method that this annotation is applied to will be invoked
 * (if the annotation is present on more than one method then an arbitrary one
 * will be chosen). The spec makes no guarantees about when it will be invoked,
 * just that is will eventually be called.
 *
 * If the annotated method is a JAX-RS resource method the id of the currently
 * running LRA can be obtained by inspecting the incoming JAX-RS headers. If
 * this LRA is nested then the parent LRA MUST be present in the header with the name
 * {@link org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation.ws.rs.LRA#LRA_HTTP_PARENT_CONTEXT_HEADER}
 * and value is of type {@link java.net.URI}.
 *
 * If the annotated method is not a JAX-RS resource method the id of the currently
 * running LRA can be obtained by adhering to a predefined method signature as
 * defined in the LRA specification document. Similarly the method may determine
 * whether or not it runs with a nested LRA by providing a parameter to hold the parent id.
 * For example,
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 *          &#64;Compensate
 *          public void compensate(URI lraId, URI parentId) { ...}
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 * would be a valid compensation method declaration. If an invalid signature is detected 
 * the {@link java.lang.RuntimeException} will be thrown during the application startup.
 *
 * Note that, according to the state model {@link LRAStatus} once an LRA has been
 * asked to cancel it is no longer possible to join with it as a participant.
 * Therefore in JAX-RS, combining this annotation with an `@LRA` annotation that does not
 * start a new LRA will result in a `412 PreCondition Failed` status code and is
 * not advised. On the other hand, combining it with an `@LRA` annotation that
 * begins a new LRA can in certain use case make sense, but in this case the LRA
 * that this method is being asked to compensate for will be unavailable.
