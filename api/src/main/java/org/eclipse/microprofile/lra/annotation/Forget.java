/**
 * <p>
 * If a participant is unable to complete or compensate immediately (i.e., it has indicated that the request has been
 * accepted and is in progress) or because of a failure (i.e., will never be able to finish) then it must remember the
 * fact (by reporting it when asked for its {@link Status}) until explicitly told that it can clean up using this
 * <code>&#64;Forget</code> annotation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Similar remarks apply if the participant was enlisted in a nested LRA
 * ({@link org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation.ws.rs.LRA.Type#NESTED}). Actions performed in the context of a nested
 * LRA must remain compensatable until the participant is explicitly told it can clean up using this
 * <code>&#64;Forget</code> annotation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the annotation is applied to a JAX-RS resource method then the request method MUST be
 * {@link jakarta.ws.rs.DELETE}. The context of the currently running LRA can be obtained by inspecting the incoming
 * JAX-RS headers. If this LRA is nested then the parent LRA MUST be present in the header with the name
 * {@link LRA#LRA_HTTP_PARENT_CONTEXT_HEADER} and value is of type {@link java.net.URI}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the annotated method is not a JAX-RS resource method, the context of the currently running LRA can be obtained by
 * adhering to a predefined method signature as defined in the LRA specification document. Similarly the method may
 * determine whether or not it runs with a nested LRA by providing a parameter to hold the parent context. For example,
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 *          &#64;Forget
 *          public void forget(URI lraId, URI parentId) { ...}
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * would be a valid forget method declaration. If an invalid signature is detected the implementation of this
 * specification MUST prohibit successful startup of the application (e.g. with a runtime exception).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since the participant generally needs to know the id of the LRA in order to clean up there is generally no benefit to
 * combining this annotation with the {@link LRA} annotation (though it is not prohibited).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Related information is provided in the javadoc for the {@link Status}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the method is a JAX-RS resource method (or is a non JAX-RS method annotated with <code>&#64;Forget</code> with
 * return type <code>jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response</code>) then the following are the only valid response codes:
 * </p>
 *
 * <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary="Valid JAX-RS response codes for Forget methods">
 * <caption><span>JAX-RS Response Codes For Forget Methods</span><span>&nbsp;</span></caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th scope="col">Code</th>
 * <th scope="col">Response Body</th>
 * <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td scope="row">200</td>
 * <td scope="row">Empty</td>
 * <td scope="row">The participant may have removed all knowledge of the LRA</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td scope="row">410</td>
 * <td scope="row">Empty</td>
 * <td scope="row">The method does not know about the LRA</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * If any other code is returned then the implementation SHOULD keep retrying. If it stops retrying, a warning message
 * SHOULD be logged.
 * </p>
