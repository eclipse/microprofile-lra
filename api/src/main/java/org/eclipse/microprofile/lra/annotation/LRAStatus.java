/**
 * A representation of the status of a Long Running Action according to a
 * LRA state model:
 *
 * The initial state {@link #Active} is entered when an LRA is created.
 *
 * The state {@link #Cancelling} is entered when a request to cancel
 * an LRA is received. The transition to end state {@link #Cancelled}
 * should occur when all the enlisted participants have indicated that
 * they successfully compensated for any actions they performed when the
 * LRA was executing. If any participant could not, and will never be able
 * to, compensate then the final state of {@link #FailedToCancel} is entered.
 *
 * The state {@link #Closing} is entered when a request to close
 * an LRA is received. The transition to end state {@link #Closed}
 * should occur when all the enlisted participants have indicated that
 * they successfully completed any actions they performed when the
 * LRA was executing. If any participant could not, and will never be able
 * to, complete then the final state of {@link #FailedToClose} is entered.
 *
 * This specification expects that this enum is consumable in JAX-RS implementations
 * passed as an entity parameter. This means that if the JAX-RS implementation does
 * not support enum types as entity parameters then the implementation of this
 * specification should provide a custom message body reader that will handle this
 * parsing.
