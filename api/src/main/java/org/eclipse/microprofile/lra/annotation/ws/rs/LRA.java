/**
 * <p>
 * An annotation for controlling the lifecycle of Long Running Actions (LRAs).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation MUST be combined with either the {@link Compensate} or the
 * {@link AfterLRA} annotation otherwise the deployment will be rejected.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The annotation <b>SHOULD</b> be applied to JAX-RS annotated methods otherwise
 * it <b>MAY</b> have no effect. The annotation determines whether or not the
 * annotated method will run in the context of an LRA and controls whether or not:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>any incoming context should be suspended and if so if a new one should be
 *       started</li>
 *   <li>to start a new LRA</li>
 *   <li>to end any LRA context when the method ends</li>
 *   <li>to return a error status code without running the annotated method if
 *       there should have been an LRA context present on method entry</li>
 *   <li>to cancel the LRA context when the method returns particular HTTP
 *       status codes</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Some of the above defined LRA operations are performed before the execution
 * proceeds to the LRA annotated business method. If any of these LRA operations
 * cannot complete the implementation MUST return one of the defined HTTP status
 * codes which means that the business method is not invoked. For the definition of
 * the allowed status codes and condition in which they are returned please
 * see the specification document.
 *
 * <p>
 * Newly created LRAs are uniquely identified and the id is referred to as the
 * LRA context. The context is passed around using a JAX-RS request/response header
 * called {@value #LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER}.
 * The implementation (of the LRA specification) is expected to manage this context
 * and the application developer is expected to declaratively control the creation,
 * propagation and destruction of LRAs using this {@link LRA} annotation. When a
 * JAX-RS resource method is invoked in the context of an LRA, any JAX-RS client
 * requests that it performs will carry the same header so that the receiving
 * resource knows that it is inside an LRA context. The behaviour may be overridden
 * by manually setting the context header.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an LRA is propagated to a resource that is not annotated with any
 * particular LRA behavior, then the value of the <code>mp.lra.propagation.active</code> configuration parameter
 * determines how the LRA is propagated. The default of this parameter is <code>true</code> which
 * means that the LRA must be propagated to outgoing requests.
 * For example, suppose resource <code>A</code>
 * starts an LRA and then performs a JAX-RS request to resource <code>B</code> which
 * does not contain any LRA annotations. If resource <code>B</code> then performs a
 * JAX-RS request to a third service, <code>C</code> say, which does contain LRA
 * annotations then the LRA context started at <code>A</code> must be propagated
 * to <code>C</code> (for example if <code>C</code> uses an annotation to join the LRA,
 * then <code>C</code> must be enlisted in the LRA that was started at <code>A</code>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Resource methods can access the LRA context id by inspecting the request headers
 * using standard JAX-RS mechanisms, ie <code>&#64;Context</code> or by injecting it via the JAX-RS
 * {@link HeaderParam} annotation with value {@value #LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER}.
 * This may be useful, for example, for associating business work with an LRA.
 * </p>

         *     An LRA (called the child) can be scoped within an existing LRA
         *     (called the parent) using the NESTED element value. A new LRA will be
         *     created even if there is already one present when the method is invoked,
         *     i.e. these LRAs will then either be top-level or nested automatically
         *     depending upon the context within which they are created. If invoked
         *     without a context the new LRA will be top level. If invoked with an
         *     LRA present a new nested LRA is started whose outcome depends upon
         *     whether or not the enclosing LRA is closed or cancelled.
         *     The id of the parent LRA MUST be present in the header with the name

         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         *     A nested LRA is treated just like any other LRA with respect to participant
         *     enlistment. When an invocation results in the creation of a nested LRA that
         *     LRA becomes the "current context" and any further operations performed by
         *     the method will be executed with that context. The semantics of nested LRAs
         *     follows previous transactions models:
         * </p>
         * <ol>
         *     <li>A nested LRA can close or cancel independently of its parent.
         *     <li>A nested LRA which has closed must retain the ability to cancel the
         *     effects if the the parent cancels. This requirement must be enforced
         *     by participants.
         *     <li>If a nested LRA cancels then all of its children must effectively cancel
         *     (even if they have previously been asked to close - see 2)
         *     <li>If a nested LRA closes then it, and all of its children, must close
         *     (but retain the ability to later cancel - see 2).
         * </ol>
         * <p>
         *     Downstream LRAs will only be part of this nesting hierarchy if the
         *     downstream methods carry the NESTED element, otherwise they are
         *     independent of the current nested LRA.
         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         *     The reason why the model does not allow a cancelled nested LRA to be closed
         *     is because the business activity has already been compensated for which means
         *     there is no longer any outstanding work in need of completion.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         *     On the other hand it does make sense to cancel the effects of a
         *     closed nested LRA since the work has been done and there is
         *     something that can be compensated for. In this case the LRA
         *     method invocation is allowed to proceed only if the participant
         *     is already enlisted with the LRA, otherwise the method invocation
         *     is rejected using a <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> HTTP
         *     status code. If the method invocation causes the LRA to close
         *     then the {@link Complete} annotated method, if present,
         *     <i>is not</i> called again. If the LRA method causes the LRA
         *     to cancel then the nested LRA is moved to the
         *     {@link org.eclipse.microprofile.lra.annotation.LRAStatus#Cancelling}
         *     state and the {@link Compensate} callback will be invoked.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         *     Therefore, as a consequence of requirement 2, any activities performed in
         *     the context of a closed nested LRA must remain compensatable until the
         *     top level parent LRA finishes. So if the nested LRA is closed the
         *     participants registered with it will be asked to complete, but if
         *     the top level parent LRA is then told to cancel the nested participants
         *     will be told to compensate. This implies that the nested participants
         *     must be aware that they are nested and the JAX-RS header with the
         *     name {@value #LRA_HTTP_PARENT_CONTEXT_HEADER} is guaranteed to hold
         *     the parent context whenever a nested LRA is being propagated.
         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         *     A participant which has completed can determine when the top level
         *     parent has closed by providing a {@link Forget} callback handler.
         *     When this method is called there is no longer a requirement to
         *     maintain the ability to reverse the effects of a closed nested LRA.
         *     This can be used by the participant to clean up any resources it used
         *     to implement this guarantee.
         * </p>
         *
         * <p>
         *     Note that it is possible for the same resource to be registered with
         *     both the parent and the child LRAs and in this case it will be asked
         *     to complete or compensate twice, once with the nested context and a
         *     second time with the parent context. The order in which the two callbacks
         *     are invoked is undefined.
         * </p>
