[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The proposal introduces APIs for services to coordinate activities.

The main thrust of the proposal introduces an API for loosely coupled
services to coordinate long running activities in such a way as to
guarantee a globally consistent outcome without the need to take locks
on data.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

In a loosely coupled service based environment there is sometimes a need
for different services to provide consistency guarantees. Typical
examples include:

* order processing involving three services (take order, bill customer,
ship product). If the shipping service finds that it is out of stock
then the customer will have been billed with no prospect of receiving
his item;
* an airline overbooks a flight which means that the booking count and
the flight capacity are inconsistent.

There are various ways that systems overcome such inconsistency but it
would be advantageous to provide a generic solution which handles
failure conditions, maintains state for those flows that span long
periods of time and ensures that remedial activities are called
correctly.

Traditional techniques for guaranteeing consistency in distributed
environments has focused on XA transactions where locks may be held for
long periods thereby introducing strong coupling between services and
decreasing concurrency to unacceptable levels. Additionally, if such a
transaction aborts then valuable work which may be valid will be rolled
back. In view of these issues an alternative approach is desirable.

Goals

* support long running actions
* no strong coupling between services
* allow actions to finish early
* allow compensating actions if a business activity is cancelled

[[proposed-solution]]
== Proposed solution

We propose a compensation based approach in which participants make
changes visible but register a compensatory action which is performed if
something goes wrong. We call the model LRA (short for Long Running
Action) and is based on work done within the
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ws-caf[OASIS
Web Services Composite Application Framework Technical Committee],
namely
https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=12794[Long
Running Action transaction model], but updated to be more suited for use
in microservice based architectures.

In the LRA model, an activity reflects business interactions: all work
performed within the scope of an activity is required to be
compensatable. Therefore, an activity’s work is either performed
successfully or undone. How services perform their work and ensure it
can be undone if compensation is required are implementation choices and
is not exposed to the LRA model which simply defines the triggers for
compensation actions and the conditions under which those triggers are
executed. In other words, an LRA coordinator is concerned only with
ensuring participants obey the protocol necessary to make an activity
compensatable (and the semantics of the business interactions are not
part of the model). Issues such as isolation of services between
potentially conflicting activities and durability of service work are
assumed to be implementation decisions. The coordination protocol used
to ensure an activity is completed successfully or compensated is not
two-phase and is intended to better model interactions between
microservices. Although this may result in non-atomic behaviour for the
overall business activity, other activities may be started by the
service to attempt to compensate in some other manner.

In the model, an LRA is tied to the scope of an activity so that when
the activity terminates the LRA coordination protocol will be
automatically performed either to accept or to compensate the work. For
example, when a user reserves a seat on a flight, the airline
reservation centre may take an optimistic approach and actually book the
seat and debit the user's account, relying on the fact that most of
their customers who reserve seats later book them; the compensation
action for this activity would be to un-book the seat and credit the
user’s account.

As in any business interaction, service activities may or may not be
compensatable. Even the ability to compensate may be a transient
capability of a service. A Compensator (or simply LRA participant) is
the LRA participant that operates on behalf of a service to undo the
work it performs within the scope of an LRA or to compensate for the
fact that the original work could not be completed.

[[the-model]]
=== The Model

The model concerns participants (aka Compensators) and a coordinator.
A client starts a new LRA via a call to an LRA coordination service.
This call creates a new LRA coordinator. When a business service does
work that may have to be later compensated for within the scope of the
LRA, it enlists a participant with the LRA coordinator. Subsequently
the client closes or cancels the LRA via the coordinator which in turn
tells all enlisted participants to either complete or compensate:

:imagesdir: images
image::lra.png[LRA Protocol Sequence]

The lifecycle of an LRA

The LRA participant will be invoked in the following way by the LRA
coordinator when the activity terminates:

* *Success*: the activity has completed successfully. If the activity is
nested then participants may propagate themselves to the enclosing LRA.
Otherwise the participants are informed that the activity has terminated
and they can perform any necessary cleanup.
* *Fail*: the activity has completed unsuccessfully. All participants
that are registered with the LRA will be invoked to perform compensation
in the reverse order. The coordinator forgets about all participants
that indicated they operated correctly. Otherwise, compensation may be
attempted again (possibly after a period of time) or alternatively a
compensation violation has occurred and must be logged. Each service is
required to log sufficient information in order to ensure (with best
effort) that compensation is possible. Each participant or subordinate
coordinator (in the case of nested LRAs) is responsible for ensuring
that sufficient data is made durable in order to undo the LRA in the
event of failures.

Interposition and check pointing of state allow the system to drive a
consistent view of the outcome and recovery actions taken, but allowing
always the possibility that recovery isn’t possible and must be logged
or flagged for the administrator.

In a large scale environment or in the presence of long term failures,
recovery may not be automatic and manual intervention may be necessary
to restore an application’s consistency.

Note that calling participants in reverse order does not guarantee that
the compensation actions will be performed in strict sequential order
since participants are allowed to indicate that the compensation is in
progress and will complete at some future time. Furthermore a
participant can indicate that it failed to compensate, or could be
unavailable in which case it will be periodically retried (out of
order).

Participants follow a state model with the following states:

* `Compensating`: a participant is currently compensating for the work
it did during the LRA;
* `Compensated`: a participant has successfully compensated for the LRA.
* `FailedToCompensate`: the participant was not able to compensate for
the LRA. It MUST maintain information about the work it was to
compensate until the coordinator sends it a forget message.
* `Completing`: the participant is tidying up after being told to
complete.
* `Completed`: the participant has confirmed that it has finished
tidying up.
* `FailedToComplete`: the participant was unable to tidy-up. It MUST
maintain information about the work it was to complete until the
coordinator sends it a forget message.

:imagesdir: images
image::lra-state-model.png[participant-state-model]

The LRA follows a similar state model:

* `Compensating`: the LRA is currently being cancelled
* `Compensated`: the LRA has successfully cancelled
* `FailedToCompensate`: one or more participants was not able to
compensate
* `Completing`: the LRA is currently being closed
* `Completed`: the LRA has closed
* `FailedToComplete`: one or more participants was not able to complete

Different usage patterns for LRAs are possible, for example LRAs may be
used sequentially and/or concurrently, where the termination of one LRA
signals the start of some other unit of work within an application.
However, LRAs are units of compensatable work and an application may
have as many such units of work operating simultaneously as it needs to
accomplish its tasks. Furthermore, the outcome of work within LRAs may
determine how other LRAs are terminated. An application can be
structured so that LRAs are used to assemble units of compensatable work
and then held in the active state while the application performs other
work in the scope of different (concurrent or sequential) LRAs. Only
when the right subset of work (LRAs) is arrived at by the application
will that subset be confirmed; all other LRAs will be told to cancel
(complete in a failure state).

In the rest of this proposal we specify two different APIs for
controlling the lifecycle of and participation in LRAs and a third API
for writing participants:

1.  link:#java-annotations-for-lras[Java Annotations for LRAs]
2.  link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/client/LRAClient.java[Client API]
* the client API is for use with containers that do not use Java annotations;
3.  link:#java-based-lra-participant-registration-api[Java based LRA
participant registration API]
* this API supports services that do not use JAX-RS

[[java-annotations-for-lras]]
=== Java Annotations for LRAs

Support for the proposal in MicroProfile is primarily based upon the use
of Java annotations for controlling the lifecycle of LRAs and participants.

[[java-annotations]]
==== Java Annotations

A JAX-RS implementation of the specification should be achievable via a
set of Java annotations which are available in the

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation[linked java package]. The service developer annotates resources to specify how
LRAs should be controlled and when to _enlist a class_ as a participant:

Controlling the lifecycle of an LRA

[source,java]
----
/**
 * An annotation for controlling the lifecycle of Long Running Actions (LRAs).
 *
 * Newly created LRAs are uniquely identified and the id is referred to as the LRA context.
 * The context is passed around using a JAX-RS request/response header called
 * LRAClient#LRA_HTTP_HEADER ("Long-Running-Action"). The implementation (of the LRA
 * specification) is expected to manage this context and the application developer is
 * expected to declaratively control the creation, propagation and destruction of LRAs using
 * the @LRA annotation. When a JAX-RS bean method is invoked in the context of an LRA any
 * JAX-RS client requests that it performs will carry the same header so that the receiving
 * resource knows that it is inside an LRA context (typically achieved using JAX-RS client
 * filters).
 *
 * Resource methods can access the context id, if required, by injecting it via the
 * JAX-RS @HeaderParam annotation. This may be useful, for example, for associating business
 * work with an LRA.

Example:

  @LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRED,
       cancelOn = {Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR} // cancel on a 500 code
       cancelOnFamily = {Response.Status.Family.CLIENT_ERROR}, // cancel on any 4xx code
       delayClose = true) // the LRA will continue to run when the method finishes
  public Response bookTrip(...) { ... }

  @PUT

  @LRA(LRA.Type.SUPPORTS,
       terminal = true) // the confirmation should trigger the closing of the LRA started in the bookTrip bean method
  public Booking confirmTrip(Booking booking) throws BookingException { ... }
----

When an LRA is present it SHOULD be made available to the business logic
via request and response headers (with the name `"Long-Running-Action"`)

Example:

[source,java]
----
  @PUT
  @Path("/confirm")
  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
  @LRA(LRA.Type.SUPPORTS, terminal = true)
  public Booking confirmTrip(
      @HeaderParam(LRAClient.LRA_HTTP_HEADER) String lraId) { ... }
----

[[compensating-activities]]
==== Compensating Activities

The application developer indicates which JAX-RS method to use for a compensating
activity by annotating it with both the `@Compensate` annotation and the JAX-RS
`@PUT` annotation. Whenever the associated resource is invoked in the context of
an LRA the endpoint corresponding to the `@Compensate` method MUST be enlisted with
the LRA. If the LRA is subsequently cancelled the compensation method MUST be invoked
by the LRA coordinator. For example:

[source,java]
----
  @PUT
  @Path("/compensate")
  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
  @Compensate
  public Response compensateWork(
      @HeaderParam(LRAClient.LRA_HTTP_HEADER) String lraId) {
    // compensate for whatever activity the business logic has associated with lraId
  }
----

The resource class MAY also contain a method marked with the `@Complete` and the
JAX-RS `@PUT` annotations. If such a method is present then the LRA
coordinator MUST invoke the method if the associated LRA is closed.
Typically the resource would use this call to perform any clean up actions. The
method is optional since such clean up actions may not be neccessary, for example
consider an online store that takes provisional bookings which are timed out if
not confirmed within a predefined period.

If the participant resource knows that it will never be able to compensate
then the activity SHOULD return a `200 OK` status code and content body
with the literal string `FailedToCompensate`. If it returns any other
content the coordinator will call JAX-RS endpoint declared by the
`@Status` method to obtain the status. If the `@Status` method is not
present the condition SHOULD be logged and this participant will be
dropped by the coordinator (ie the participant should avoid this
circumstance). Similar remarks apply if the resource method knows that it
will never be able to complete.

If the resource cannot perform a compensation or completion activity
immediately the termination method MUST indicate the condition. In this
case the LRA coordinator will need to monitor the progress of the
participant and the developer should either provide a `@GET` method
annotated with `@Status` which must return a
link:#participant-state-model[string representation of the status]
or expect the compensator to be called again (ie the method
must be idempotent). The resource indicates that it cannot finish
immediately by either

* returning a `202 Accepted` HTTP status code or
* the method is marked as a JAX-RS asynchronous method (using the
`javax.ws.rs.container.Suspended` annotation).

When the coordinator knows it has the final status it will inform the
participant that it can clean up. The developer indicates which method
to use for this purpose by annotating one of the methods with the JAX-RS
`@DELETE` and the `@Forget` annotations. If the developer wishes to report
the status using some other resource then it MAY provide a status
URL in the response Location header of the complete/compensate endpoint
invocation. If the developer has not provided a status URL then a warning
is logged when the asynchronous termination method finishes.

If the `@Compensate` or `@Complete` annotation is present on multiple methods
then an arbitrary one is chosen. If the annotation is not accompanied by
a JAX-RS `@PUT` annotation the error should be reported using a JAX-RS
exception mapper that maps to a `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP status code.

[[nesting-lras]]
==== Nesting LRAs

An activity can be scoped within an existing LRA using the `@NestedLRA`
annotation. Invoking a method marked with this annotation will start a
new LRA whose outcome depends upon whether the enclosing LRA is closed
or cancelled.

* If the nested LRA is closed but the outer LRA is cancelled then the
participants registered with the nested LRA will be told to compensate.
* If the nested LRA is cancelled the outer LRA can be still closed.

Note that there is no annotation to directly cancel a closed nested LRA
and the link:#lra-client-api[Java LRAClient api] must be
used for this purpose if required.

[[timing-out-lras-and-compensators]]
==== Timing out LRAs and Compensators

The ability to compensate may be a transient capability of a service so
participants (and LRAs) can be timed out after which the compensator is
called (the LRA is cancelled).

To set such a time limit use the `@TimeLimit` annotation, for example:

[source,java]
----
  @GET
  @Path("/doitASAP")
  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
  @TimeLimit(limit = 100, unit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
  @LRA(value = LRA.Type.REQUIRED)
  public Response theClockIsTicking(
      @HeaderParam(LRAClient.LRA_HTTP_HEADER) String lraId) {...}
----

[[leaving-an-lra]]
==== Leaving an LRA

If a user calls a method annotated with `@Leave` while this bean method
is executed in the context of a LRA then if the bean class has
registered a participant with the active LRA it will be removed from the
LRA just before the bean method is called (and will not be asked to
complete or compensate when the LRA is subsequently ended).

[[reporting-the-status-of-a-participant]]
==== Reporting the status of a participant

As alluded to above, participants can provide a method for reporting the
status of the participant by annotating one of the methods with the
`@Status` annotation. The method is required when at least one the
participant methods that is annotated with `@Compensate` or `@Complete`
is not able to complete the task immediately. If the participant has not
finished - ie. it has not yet been asked to `@Compensate` or `@Complete`
it should report the error using a JAX-RS exception mapper that maps to
a `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP status code (such as
IllegalLRAStateException or InvalidStateException). Otherwise the
response entity must correspond to one of the Strings defined by
following enum values (as reported by the enum `name()` method):

[source,java]
----
/**
 * The status of a participant. The status is only valid after the coordinator has told the participant to
 * complete or compensate. The name value of the enum should be returned by any method marked with
 * the {@link Status} annotation.
 */
public enum CompensatorStatus {
    Compensating, // the Compensator is currently compensating for the LRA.
    Compensated, //  the Compensator has successfully compensated for the LRA.
    FailedToCompensate, //  the Compensator was not able to compensate for the LRA
                // (and must remember it could not compensate until it receives a forget message).
    Completing, //  the Compensator is tidying up after being told to complete.
    Completed, //  the Compensator has confirmed.
    FailedToComplete, //  the Compensator was unable to tidy-up.
}
----

Notice that the enum constants correspond to
link:#participant-state-model[participant state model].

[[forgetting-an-lra]]
==== Forgetting an LRA

If a participant is unable to complete or compensate immediately then it
must remember the fact until explicitly told that it can clean up using
the `@Forget` annotation. The method annotated with the `@Forget`
annotation is a standard REST endpoint expected to be used with JAX-RS
`@DELETE` annotation.

[[lra-client-api]]
=== LRA Client API

For completeness the proposal supports clients that wish to directly
control LRAs and participants. To support this class of user an instance
of
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/client/LRAClient.java[LRA client API] can be instantiated directly or injected if the client is

[[java-based-lra-participant-registration-api]]
=== Java based LRA participant registration API

For those applications that cannot directly expose JAX-RS endpoints for
compensation activities this specification optionally supports an API
for directly registering participants. A participant is a serializable
java class that is interested in LRA lifecycle notifications, and does
so by registering an instance of `LRAParticipant` with an instance of an
`LRAManagement`:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * The API for notifying participants that an LRA is completing or cancelling.
 * A participant joins with an LRA via a call to
 * {@link LRAManagement#joinLRA(LRAParticipant, LRAParticipantDeserializer, URL, Long, TimeUnit)}
 */
public interface LRAParticipant extends Serializable {
    /**
     * Notifies the participant that the LRA is closing
     * @param lraId the LRA that is closing
     * @return null if the participant completed successfully. If the participant cannot
     *         complete immediately it should return a future that the caller can use
     *         to monitor progress. If the JVM crashes before the participant can finish
     *         it should expect this method to be called again. If the participant fails
     *         to complete it must cancel the future or throw a TerminationException.
     * @throws NotFoundException the participant does not know about this LRA
     * @throws TerminationException the participant was unable to complete and will never
     *         be able to do so
     */
    Future<Void> completeWork(URL lraId) throws NotFoundException, TerminationException;

    /**
     * Notifies the participant that the LRA is cancelling
     * @param lraId the LRA that is closing
     * @return null if the participant completed successfully. If the participant cannot
     *         complete immediately it should return a future that the caller can use

     *         it should expect this method to be called again. If the participant fails

     * @throws NotFoundException the participant does not know about this LRA
     * @throws TerminationException the participant was unable to complete and will never
     *         be able to do so
     */
    Future<Void> compensateWork(URL lraId) throws NotFoundException, TerminationException;

where the registration interface is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface LRAManagement {
    /**
     * Join an existing LRA
     *
     * @param participant an instance of a {@link LRAParticipant} that will be notified when the target LRA ends
     * @param deserializer a mechanism for recreating participants during recovery.
     *                     If the parameter is null then standard Java object deserialization will be used
     * @param lraId the LRA that the join request pertains to
     * @param timeLimit the time for which the participant should remain valid. When this time limit is exceeded
     *                  the participant may longer be able to fulfil the protocol guarantees.
     * @param unit the unit that the timeLimit parameter is expressed in
     */
    String joinLRA(LRAParticipant participant, LRAParticipantDeserializer deserializer,
                   URL lraId, Long timeLimit, TimeUnit unit) throws JoinLRAException;

    /**
     * Join an existing LRA. In contrast to the other form of registration this method does not indicate a time limit
     * for the participant meaning that the participant registration will remain valid until it terminates successfully
     * or unsuccessfully (ie it will never be timed out externally).
     *
     * @param participant an instance of a {@link LRAParticipant} that will be notified when the target LRA ends
     * @param deserializer a mechanism for recreating participants during recovery.
     *                     If the parameter is null then standard Java object deserialization will be used
     * @param lraId the LRA that the join request pertains to
     */
    String joinLRA(LRAParticipant participant, LRAParticipantDeserializer deserializer, URL lraId) throws JoinLRAException;
}
----

How the application obtains an LRAManagement instance is unspecified
(for example the reference implementation does it by CDI injection). The
deserializer, if provided, must match the interface

[source,java]
----
/**
 * An object that knows how to recreate a participant from its' persistent form
 */
public interface LRAParticipantDeserializer {
    LRAParticipant deserialize(byte[] recoveryState);
}
----

Compensators must be serializable for this approach to work.

The purpose of the deserializer covers recovery scenarios (where one or
more components fail): the framework must guarantee that participants
will still be triggered (the LRA protocol still provides the "all or
nothing" guarantees that traditional transactions give). The
deserializer provides a mechanism for the recovery component to recreate
participants from their persistent form. Note that, in contrast to the
JAX-RS based support, an installation must ensure that the java class
definitions of Compensators be made available to the recovery system.
Serializable participants need to know how to contact the original
business application in order to trigger compensation activities whereas
the JAX-RS based solution need only persist resource paths which are likely
to correspond to existing microservice endpoints. In other words, from
an administrative and manageability point of view, it is desirable to
use one of the other APIs such as the link:#java-annotations-for-lras[Java
Annotations for LRAs].

_In the reference implementation recovery is achieved by depending on an
maven artifact that automatically starts up a proxy participant which
listens for replay requests. For this to work the proxy must start up on
the same endpoint or it must be told where the coordinator resides so
that it can inform the coordinator of its new location: the way in which
participants can report their location is not defined in this version of
the specification but the reference implementation achieves the behaviour
via an HTTP PUT operation on the `recovery URL`. If a service is restarted
the classes for any previously registered compensators must be on available
on the classpath._

[[appendix-1]]
== Appendix 1

[[typical-recovery-scenarios]]
=== Typical Recovery Scenarios

Setup:

* Start 2 services and an LRA coordinator
* Start an LRA and enlist both services

[[scenario-1]]
==== Scenario 1

* Kill the coordinator before closing the LRA
* Restart the coordinator which should cause the LRA to be reloaded
(from a log in persistent storage)
* Since the LRA is still active recovery should leave it alone
* Close the LRA. For example if you have curl:
** `curl http://localhost:8080/lra-coordinator/recovery`
** `curl -X put http://localhost:8080/lra-coordinator/{LRAId}/close`
* Each service should be told to complete (and the log should be
removed)

[[scenario-2]]
==== Scenario 2

* Kill one of the services before closing the LRA
* The LRA close will fail because one of the services is down
* Periodic recovery should keep retrying to close the LRA (even if you
restart the coordinator it should still replay the close)
* Restart the service
* Periodic recovery should now successfully close the LRA

[[scenario-3]]
==== Scenario 3

* Crash the second service after the first one has completed (this
generates a heuristic)
* Restart the second service
* Periodic recovery should replay the complete on the failed participant
* NB if you restart the coordinator before the last step then the
recovery should replay all participants (since it will re-read the whole
list).

[[scenarios-4-5-and-6]]
==== Scenarios 4, 5 and 6

* And similarly, the same 3 scenarios but cancelling an LRA instead of
closing it.
